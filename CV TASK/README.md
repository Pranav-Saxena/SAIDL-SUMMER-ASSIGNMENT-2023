I was unable to finsh the CV task, but I was able to implement CLIPseg zero shot segmentation on the example figure given in the assignment doc

Also, while researching about models which can be used as a decoder for binary segmentation, one of the model architecture could be a U-net model architecture whose code I have shared in this repo

Another possible architecture could be a LinkNet Architecture for performing binary segmentation
